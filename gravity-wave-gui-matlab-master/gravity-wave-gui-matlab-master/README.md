# gravity-wave-gui-matlab

Detects gravity waves in Graw DFM-09 radiosonde profiles using a wavelet-based Stokes parameters method. 
Also included is a matlab app that does analysis file-by-file and saves significant levels in the atmosphere.
runFile has a few toggleable arguments, but all of the gravity wave detection and subsequent parameter extraction is 
automated. 


visualizeGravityWave data is just a script to plot various parameters in the data.
