This app is a tool that aids visual inspection of the wavelet power
surfaces calculated from radiosonde data. The power surfaces give a 
qualitative view of wave activity in a given sounding - bright areas
in the power surface correspond to enhanced gravity wave activity.

This app also expects users to enter significant levels in the 
atmosphere. The levels (wind shear, tropopause, PBL, jets) all
impact gravity wave generation and propagation characteristics.
Levels like the tropopause and PBL can reflect and refract gravity waves.
To try and isolate the sources of gravity waves in the atmosphere,
disturbances like those enumerated above must be recorded and analyzed.

There are a few user variables that can be changed - the altitude that 
the analysis is performed over, and the directory in which the gravity wave
data is saved in. These options are found in the drop-down menu in the top left.
