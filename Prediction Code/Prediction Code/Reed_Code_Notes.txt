WRFDriver.py is main code. It calls Calculations.py and WRFPredictions.py which calls WRFReader.py

Need Nio (PyNIO) to run WRFReader.py which reads NetCDF WRF files to grab Temp, Pressure, Lat, Long, and wind values.

Prediction method called under "def Prediction" from WRFDriver.py

In Prediction.py:

"hour_duration" part of code says If over 1hour then grab next wrf file - can we pull form one file?
"22:24" are index of WRF time so pulls out next time and increments by one hour.

"Return points" just stores values in computer memory.

In WRFDRiver.py:
Saves file of output values.
